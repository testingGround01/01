# Mathex Single Page App

`app.html` is the main entry point. Pass `?area=dashboard`, `practice`, or `study` to jump directly to a section. Legacy pages (`dashboard.html`, `practice.html`, `study.html`, and `review.html`) now simply redirect to the corresponding area in `app.html` for backward compatibility.

`session-result.html` remains a standalone page with its own styles and script.

Use `index.html` to navigate to the desired section.
