# Mathex Split Pages

This repository now contains separate HTML files for each page of the application.
Most pages now load their common styles from `style.css`. The `session-result.html` page also loads additional styles and scripts from separate files.

- `dashboard.html`
- `practice.html`
- `study.html`
- `review.html`
- `session-result.html` (with `session-result.css` and `session-result.js`)

Use `index.html` to access links to these pages.
